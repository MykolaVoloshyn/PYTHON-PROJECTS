### BlueBirdBanking
BlueBirdBanking is a Django-based web application designed to help users manage multiple bank accounts with ease. This project allows users to create accounts, log transactions, and monitor account balances—all through a clean and functional web interface. It shows how Django can be used for financial tracking with a web interface.

### Classes
A Django web app for managing university campuses and classes. The admin panel allows adding, editing, and deleting campus details (like name, state, ID) and class information (like number, name, professor). Good practice with Django’s admin interface.

### File Transfer Application
A Tkinter app that moves files between folders. It checks the modification date and only transfers files updated within the last 24 hours. Older versions in the destination are replaced with newer ones. This project focuses on file handling and working with directories in Python.

### Nice Or Mean Game
A text-based Python game where the player meets strangers and chooses to be nice or mean. The choices affect the score and lead to different outcomes (winning or losing). Includes sound effects and the option to play again while keeping track of the player’s score and name.

### Phonebook Application
A simple phone book app that saves contacts with a name, phone number, and email address into a database. It also allows updating and deleting existing entries. A beginner-friendly project for practicing CRUD operations with Python and databases.

### Web Page Generator
A Python app with Tkinter that creates basic HTML pages. It can generate a default page with a message or let the user type custom text. The page then opens in the browser, making it an easy way to practice working with Python GUIs and HTML generation.
